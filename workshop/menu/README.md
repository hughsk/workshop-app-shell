# @workshop/menu

The menu page that kicks off the workshop.

Essentially runs as a very small beefy server which links out to the other
exercises, sourced from the `exercises.json` file that you can find in
the project root.

You shouldn't need to touch this directly, it's pulled in by
[`@workshop/server`](../server).
